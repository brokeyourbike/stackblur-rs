# stackblur-rs
Rust port of the [StackBlur](http://incubator.quasimondo.com/processing/fast_blur_deluxe.php) method by Mario Klingemann.

StackBlur is a compromise between Gaussian blur and Box blur, but it creates much better looking blurs than Box blur and it is ~7x faster than Gaussian blur.

## Performance
